# CHAPTER-3: Transport Layer

The Transport Layer is the fourth layer of the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) and TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) network models. Its primary function is to provide end-to-end data transport services between applications running on different hosts or devices.

The Transport Layer is responsible for ensuring reliable data transfer between source and destination hosts by establishing connections, managing data segmentation and reassembly, and performing error detection and correction. The most common protocols at this layer are TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol).

TCP provides reliable, connection-oriented data transfer services by establishing a virtual circuit between the source and destination hosts before transferring data. It breaks data into segments, adds sequencing and error checking information, and reassembles them at the receiver end. TCP provides flow control and congestion control mechanisms to ensure that data is transmitted at an optimal rate and to avoid network congestion.

UDP, on the other hand, is a connectionless, unreliable protocol that provides best-effort data transfer services. It does not establish a connection before transferring data and does not perform error correction or flow control. UDP is used for applications that require low-latency and high-throughput, such as real-time multimedia streaming, online gaming, and voice-over-IP (VoIP).

In summary, the Transport Layer is responsible for providing end-to-end data transport services, including reliability, error detection and correction, flow control, and congestion control. TCP and UDP are the most commonly used protocols at this layer, with TCP providing reliable, connection-oriented data transfer services, and UDP providing best-effort, connectionless data transfer services.
