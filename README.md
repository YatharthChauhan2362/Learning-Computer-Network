# Protocols

In networking, a protocol refers to a set of rules or standards that govern the way devices communicate with each other over a network. A protocol determines how data is transmitted, received, and processed over the network.

Protocols are essential for enabling communication between different devices and ensuring that the data is transmitted correctly and reliably. There are many different types of protocols used in networking, including:

1. Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) 
- This is the most widely used protocol suite for communication on the internet.

2. User Datagram Protocol (UDP) 
- A lightweight protocol used for quick data transmission where reliability is not the primary concern.

3. Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) 
- A protocol used for transmitting web pages and other data over the internet.

4. Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) 
- A protocol used for sending email messages over the internet.

5. File Transfer Protocol (FTP) 
- A protocol used for transferring files between computers over the internet.

Each protocol has its own specific set of rules and standards that devices must follow to ensure successful communication.

# Access Networks

Access networks, in networking, refer to the portion of a telecommunications network that connects subscribers or end-users to the core network or the internet.

There are different types of access networks, including:

1. Wired access networks 
- These networks use physical cables, such as copper or fiber optic cables, to connect end-users to the network. Examples of wired access networks include Digital Subscriber Line (DSL), cable modem, and Ethernet.

2. Wireless access networks 
- These networks use wireless signals, such as radio waves or microwave, to connect end-users to the network. Examples of wireless access networks include Wi-Fi, cellular networks, and satellite networks.

Access networks are essential for providing users with access to network services, such as the internet, voice, and video. They also play a crucial role in determining the quality of service that end-users receive, including factors such as bandwidth, latency, and reliability.

In summary, access networks are the final link between end-users and the telecommunications network or the internet. They are critical to providing access to network services and determining the quality of service that end-users receive.

# Physical media

Physical media in networking refers to the type of cables and wires that are used to transmit data between devices on a network. There are several types of physical media commonly used in networking:

1. Twisted Pair: 
- Twisted pair cables are the most commonly used type of cable in networking. They consist of pairs of copper wires twisted together to reduce interference and crosstalk.

2. Coaxial Cable: 
- Coaxial cable is a type of cable consisting of a central conductor surrounded by an insulating layer, a conductive shield, and a protective outer jacket. It is used in cable television and some networking applications.

3. Fiber Optic Cable: 
- Fiber optic cable uses thin strands of glass or plastic to transmit data over long distances. It offers very high bandwidth and is used in high-speed networking applications.

4. Wireless: 
- Wireless networking uses radio waves to transmit data between devices. It eliminates the need for physical cables but can be affected by interference from other devices.

The choice of physical media depends on factors such as the distance between devices, the speed of the network, and the level of interference present in the environment.

# Packet Switching & Circuit Switching

Packet switching and circuit switching are two different methods of transmitting data over a network.

Circuit Switching

- Circuit switching is an older technology that is used in traditional telephone networks. It works by creating a dedicated physical connection, or circuit, between two devices for the duration of the communication. The circuit is reserved exclusively for the two devices and cannot be used by anyone else. This means that the communication is uninterrupted, but it also means that the circuit remains occupied even when no data is being transmitted, leading to inefficient use of resources.

Packet switching
- Packet switching, on the other hand, is the method used in modern computer networks, including the internet. In packet switching, data is broken down into small packets and sent over the network individually. Each packet contains a portion of the data, as well as the address of its destination. The packets travel through the network separately and can take different paths to reach their destination. When they arrive at their destination, they are reassembled into the original message. Packet switching allows multiple devices to share the same network resources, which makes it more efficient than circuit switching.

In summary, circuit switching creates a dedicated physical connection between two devices for the duration of the communication, while packet switching breaks data down into small packets and sends them individually over the network, allowing multiple devices to share the same network resources. Packet switching is the method used in modern computer networks, while circuit switching is an older technology used in traditional telephone networks.
